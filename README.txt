Project Title: Trex Runner Game
Welcome to my Trex Runner Game project! This project showcases my skills in game development using p5.js, a JavaScript library. Below, I'll provide an overview of the project and highlight the key features and skills demonstrated.

Project Overview
Trex Runner Game is a simple yet engaging endless runner game where the player controls a character (Trex) and guides it through obstacles while collecting points. The game features dynamic obstacles, cloud elements, and a scoring system. It also includes game over and restart functionalities.

Key Features
Dynamic Obstacles: The game generates random obstacles at intervals, providing variety and challenge to the gameplay.
Cloud Elements: Clouds appear randomly in the sky, adding visual interest to the game environment.
Scoring System: Players earn points as they progress through the game, with the score displayed prominently on the screen.
Game Over and Restart: When the player fails to avoid an obstacle, the game ends, displaying a game over screen with an option to restart the game.
